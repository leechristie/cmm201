    "## Different Ways to Import\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different styles of importing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is importing the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import random\n",
    "    \n",
    "    x = random.randint(1, 6)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This is probably the most common way to import. Note that we need to prefix each call with `random.` to tell Python which package to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is importing only the functions we need:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    from random import randint\n",
    "    \n",
    "    x = randint(1, 6)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This way we only import what we need, and don't need to prefix the package name each call. If we need to import multiple things, we can use commas:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from random import randint, shuffle, sample\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are are small number of things you need from the package, then this is common.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there is importing everything from the package (also called **star imports**):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    from random import *\n",
    "    \n",
    "    x = randint(1, 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be used if you use a lot of things from a package and don't want to keep typing `random.`\n",
    "\n",
    "In general we recommend the standard import style: `import random`\n",
