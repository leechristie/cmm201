Typically, these editors will support a wider set of features such as code completion using a language server, support for version control and refactoring tools. Note that some of the instructions in the labs relating to user interface such as text in menus and specific buttons will be different in different editors, and the layout of some of these most fully-featured editors can be overwhelming to new programmers compared to the simplicity of Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab.\n",
