    "In this case, although floating-point numbers have values for `0.1`, `0.2`, and `0.3`, something goes wrong when adding `0.1` to `0.2`. This is because the computer is bad at counting decimal (base-10) numbers this way.\n",

    "But if you are every building a program which deals extensively with monetary calculation and these kind of precision errors are a problem, there are alternatives such as the Python `Decimal` type, or storing numbers of pennies as integers. These are both approaches taken by commercial software involving monetary calculations. Calculations on an integer numbers of pennies are exact. And types such as `Decimal` are abstractions which will calculate with integers but display as decimal values."
